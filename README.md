# Task Board
Simple task board app, with viewer only mode.

I have a tablet acting as a display on my door. I need people to know what I'm working on at any given time of day, and whether I can be disturbed or not. This provides the simple/yet specific functionality I need.

    * [elm-ui](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui)
* Python3
    * [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
